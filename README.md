Reproducible Science &amp; Figures Assessment | FHS, 2024

This is an investigation of the Palmer Penguin dataset. The Palmer Penguins dataset records observations of foraging Ad√©lie (Pygoscelis adeliae), Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguin species, near the Palmer Station, in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. Recorded observations for each individual notes the specific species, as well as the specific island (of Briscoe, Dream or Torgersen) in the Anvers region; as well as the developmental stage. Each observation is given an ID. Data collected include: clutch completion (either yes or no), the date of egg laying (YYYY-MM-DD), culmen length and depth as well as flipper length (all measured in mm), body mass (measured in grams), and sex (M/F).

I investigate the correlation between body mass (g) and flipper length (mm).
